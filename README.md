# Nexus: A TRON-Native Metaverse Marketplace

This project was built as a submission to the TRON Grand Hackathon Season 3.

### Context

According to experts, the metaverse industry is expected to be worth between 3 to 12 trillion dollars by 2030. However, the problem with the current metaverse space is that digital assets available in each metaverse are confined to that environment due to the centralized nature of their storage. Now what do I mean by that? So if there’s metaverse A and B, and metaverse A goes down, a user cannot simply migrate the assets they owned from metaverse A to metaverse B because the two environments don’t have a shared storage state.

### Problem

This is why we believe all metaverse assets in the future will be hosted as non-fungible tokens tied to a blockchain. By doing so, assets will be interoperable across all metaverses and have their ownership verifiable on-chain.

We believe TRON blockchain has the potential to be the blockchain to power metaverses in the future due to its high-efficiency and low-cost environment to store digital assets.

Now in this future, what if there was a single place that anyone across any metaverse can come create and trade their digital assets with others? We believe in order for creators and game developers to easily create 3D assets for the metaverse, there must be a platform that allows them to create, trade, and showcase their assets in a seamless manner.

### Vision

This is why we've built Nexus. A TRON-native 3D asset marketplace for users in the metaverse to seamlessly create, trade, and showcase their 3D metaverse assets.

Some of the features include but are not limited to:

- NFT Marketplace protocol for seamless buying and selling of 3D NFTs
- No-code minting of 3D NFTs (metadata on decentralized storage via IPFS)
- Interactive 3D model viewer to preview assets before purchase
- Showcasing of user-owned 3D NFT assets via user profiles
- Well-documented API to integrated Nexus 3D NFTs into any metaverse

The vision of Nexus is to become the one-stop shop to serve all TRON-based metaverse platforms for their on-chain asset needs. We are extremely excited to showcase this prototype and would love to hear feedback from the TRON core team.

### Deployed Contracts:

- Nexus Protocol v1 (Shasta Tronscan: [TKiEgTFAkWKTqNy2NUBStofBETw8x8H9Rw](https://shasta.tronscan.org/#/contract/TKiEgTFAkWKTqNy2NUBStofBETw8x8H9Rw/code))
- Nexus Collection 3 (Shasta Tronscan: [TVjHb2Sj5qA5kLEoNUJDksfZ1P2FXy7rNs]())

### Next Steps

This was a proof of concept built in the span of a month. But we are interested in continuing to pursue this project. Our next steps are as follows:

- Integrate NFT indexer to showcase all 3D NFTs
- Creating an interoperable 3D NFT metadata standard for TRON
- Adding advanced trading options (limit trades, auctions)
- Rigorous testing and feedback from TRON community
- Adding programmatic batch minting NFTs
- Support metaverse asset conversions (i.e. .gltf/.glb, .obj, .fbx)
- Adding NFT analytics (price appraisal, floor price tracking)
- Adding social features (follow, like, comment on assets)
- Support for dynamic 3D NFTs that evolve with on-chain data
- NFT verification feature to combat clone projects
